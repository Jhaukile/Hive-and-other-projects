Hello! 
Welcome to my HTTP API assignment. All you have to do is press run and it should work. To test this program, I advise to use Postman or similar programs. 
I left comments so it would be easy to follow what they exactly do, but removing them would make the code easier to read. Hopefully this isn't a problem.

I tested this assignment with Postman. I POST:ed the example JSON data in Postman to localhost:5000/ and it returned the delivery fee in response as it was expected.
